**YouDoYou** is a gamified to-do list. It enables users to solidify good habits and help ensure completion of tasks by giving simple (pixelated) rewards for completing tasks.

It is a re-incarnation of a previous project: [YouDoYou-java](https://github.com/Atticus29/YouDoYou)

It is created in Ionic2, so it will run on Android, iOS, or your browser.
