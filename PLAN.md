# PLAN

General plan for YouDoYou, divvied up into must have/want to have/dream of having/finished.

## MUST
#### Sets
* Make sets
  * Sets look mostly like normal todos
  * Arrow on far right to drop down each todo in set (slight inlay on left to make evident todos are part of set OR some colorization)
  * Sets get bonus experience on completion
  * Set task into set
* Sets that can repeat entire contents daily/etc (IE "getting ready for work")

#### Skills
* Skills
  * ~~Make skills~~
  * ~~Skills have experience~~
    * ~~Skills get experience by completing tasks in that skill~~
  * ~~Skill list in profile~~ (or grid?)
  * Maybe there should be skill "categories"? For use with default background pictures/better sorting. Health/Fitness/Education/Work/etc

#### Screens

###### Todo
* Better info in todo screen
  * ~~Todo description~~
  * ~~Todo difficulty~~ (icons?!)
  * Due dates to better format
    * If this week, use day (on Friday? Friday? this Friday?)
    * If this month, use day and date (Friday the 13th? Fri the 13th?)
    * Else, use day date month (Fri, June 13th)
  * Estimated time (clock icon, ~~25 min.~~)
  * ~~Experience on complete?~~
  * ~~Repeat~~
  * ~~Reward (if any)~~
* Update option shows add-todo form instead of the measly 2 field option
* Repeat does something
* Say something nice to the user on complete (random toasts)

###### Completed
* Better info in completed screen
  * Completed description
  * Completed difficulty (icons?!)
  * Completed dates to better format
    * If this week, use day (on Friday? Friday? this Friday?)
    * If this month, use day and date (Friday the 13th? Fri the 13th?)
    * Else, use day date month (Fri, June 13th)
  * Estimated time (clock icon, ~~25 min.~~)
  * Experience on complete?
  * Repeat
  * Reward (if any)

###### Profile
* User-settable background pictures for skills, or something similar (need some default images)
* Ability to upload profile picture/use some sort of default
* Ability to update display name from email
* Clicking on skill should show more info about that skill? Or more likely filter all todos/completed by that skill

#### General
* Colors/themes
* H/D/M/Y selector on estimated time slider
* Add new skill from new todo popover (can't use any popups though)
* Ability to delete a skill
* When moving completed todos back to todo list, remove XP gained from completing it (make a de-level check? Ugh)
* Ability to copy a completed todo to todo list (not uncomplete, copy)

## WANT
* Google sign in
* User settable colors/themes
* Notifications/reminders
* Move level up and various other checks to Firebase Functions
* Separate Angular website more refined for desktop
* Quick new user tutorial


## DREAM
* User avatar generator or something. This...yeah, this.
* This could also be a FF-esque skill tree? Vertical tree with nodes showing progress? (think reddit-a-roo infographic)
* Achievements. This could use google play games

## FINISHED
* ~~Firebase nodes by UID~~
* ~~New task to form with validation~~
* ~~Sliders for difficulty, time (look at gluhg)~~
* ~~Tabbed navigation~~
* * ~~User is player, has experience etc~~
* ~~Mark tasks done~~
* ~~Send marked tasks to separate list~~
