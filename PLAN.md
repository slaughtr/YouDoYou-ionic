# PLAN

General plan for YouDoYou, divvied up into must have/want to have/dream of having.

## MUST
* ~~User is player, has experience etc~~
* ~~Mark tasks done~~
* ~~Send marked tasks to separate list~~
* Make sets
  * Sets look mostly like normal todos
  * Arrow on far right to drop down each todo in set (slight inlay on left to make evident todos are part of set OR some colorization)
  * Sets get bonus experience on completion
  * Set task into set
* Skills
  * ~~Make skills~~
  * Skills have experience
  * Skill list in profile (or grid?)
  * User-settable background pictures for skills, or something similar
* Better info in main screen
  * Skill description
  * Skill difficulty (icons?)
  * Due dates to better format
    * If this week, use day (on Friday? Friday? this Friday?)
    * If this month, use day and date (Friday the 13th? Fri the 13th?)
    * Else, use day date month (Fri, June 13th)
  * Estimated time (clock icon, 25 min.)
  * Experience on complete?
  * Repeat
  * Reward (if any)
* More MDL: https://getmdl.io/components/index.html
* Colors/themes
* ~~Firebase nodes by UID~~
* ~~New task to form with validation~~
* ~~Sliders for difficulty, time (look at gluhg)~~
* ~~Tabbed navigation~~


## WANT
